## What Is it?
Simple notepad script

Allows players to place notes on the ground as crumpled pieces of paper (the prop) and other players can view them

Good for leaving info behind, eg for people roleplaying serial killers or whatever, or just telling people they need to do something

The notes will also be removed at server/script restart
